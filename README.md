# AMIGO - A Mental Health App

   Amigo, your personal mental health tracker, has 3 main functionalities. The 'Journaling' feature offers a safe space for the users to pen down their thoughts and feelings. The 'Happiness Tracker' feature makes the user answer to a set of questions asked about his mood and then later provides an analysis of their mood. The 'Connect to Therapist' feature aks the user questions about their preference of the therapist they would like to consult, based on which the users are given a filtered list of therapists and their details.
